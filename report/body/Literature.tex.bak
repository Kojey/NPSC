\section{The human sleep-wake cycle}
\subsection{The circadian rhythm}

Many of our seasonal behaviour are synchronised to the environment by \textbf{biological clocks} responsible for the creation of circadian rhythms. Biological clocks which are composed of protein that act reciprocally on the body's cells are the natural timing device found in many organs. The discovery of the genes from these biological clocks responsible for the control of the circadian rhythms was made by three scientists Jeffrey  C.  Hall,  Michael  Rosbash  and Michael W. Young winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \cite{sc2017}. Their discovery made in the 1980s led to advanced research on the role of the circadian rhythms.\\
Circadian rhythms are biological rhythms which follow the same pattern in absence of external cues (endegenous), are influenced by the presence of external stimuli (entertainable), oxillating every 24h over a range of phisiological temperatures. In the presence of external stimuli -also known as \textit{zeitgebers}-, circadian rhythms synchronise their periodicity with these external stimuli. The zeitgebers of the circadian are the daily variation of the temperature and the dark/light cycle of the day.\\
Circadian rhythms have an endegenous and an exogenous components. Human placed in isolation without knowledge of the time continued exhibiting a circadian rhythm with their pacemakers notably the melatonin secretion, sleep-wake cycle, body temperature \cite{in1996}. These results proove the endegenous component of the circadian rhythms. A similar study shows that when people are exposed to light at night time, a shift in their pacemakers \cite{ea2004} which is an evidence of the exogenous component of circadian rhythms.\\
The exogenous components of the circadian rhythms have the ability affect positively and begatively our natural endogenous cycle. With light being what we are mostly daily exposed to, what is the influence of light on the circadian thythms? 

\subsection{Internal circadian rhythms influenced by light}
Melatonin is the hormone produced by the pineal gland in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) which has a soporific effect and the ability to entertain the sleep-wake cycle. While melatonin itself is not the cause of a person sleeping, it however creates changes in a person's body that affect their sleepiness. \\
The pineal gland responsible for the secretion of the melatonin hormone is under the influence of one of the biological clocks, the master clock located in the SCN. The SCN receives visual information from the retinal-hypothalamic tract which entrains the SCN according to the photoperiod \cite{lo1994}. The SCN in turn activate a gene in the pineal cell (CREM) which produce a protein (ICER) needed for the production of melatonin. As a result, the secretion of pineal hormone melatonin follow the light/dark cycle with its  secretion being high during the day and low during the night.  

\subsection{Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of light on melatonin production}
Many researches have been done to understand the impact of light on the circadian rhythms expecially the sleep-wake cycle. \\
Kathleen \textit{et al.} in their paper \textit{Blue light from light-emitting diodes elicits a dose-dependent suppression of melatonin in humans}\cite{bl2010}, provide details information on their finding of  the effect of light on humans subject. Subjects used for the expirements were 5 males and 3 females with an mean of $23.9\pm0.5$ years, with each subject demonstrating normal color vision. The lighting requirment was blue light of $\lambda_{max} = 469nm \pm 1nm $ with $\frac{1}{2}$ peak bandwidth$ = 26nm$ and a typical viewing distance of $35cm$. The subjects were blindfolded from midnight to 2AM. From thereon, they were exposed to 90 min of blue light exposure  followed by another dark exposure. Blood sample from the subject were taken from 2AM at 30 min interval.From their experiment, they concluded that:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Blue LED light has an increased melatonin supression following an increase in exposure irradiance}
\item \textbf{Blue LED light may have stronger suppressing effect than 4000K white fluorescent light.}
\end{itemize}
A similar study was previously made by George C. Brainard \textit{et al.} \cite{ac2001} used 72 healthy human subjects, with normal color vision. The subjects composed of 37 females, 35 males, aged between 18 and 30 years (mean age of $24.5 \pm 0.3$ years), came from different ethnic (african, african americans, caucasians, asian, hispanic). The melatonin suppression action spectrum was formed using eight different wavelengths between $440nm$ and $600nm$ \textit{(440, 460, 480, 505, 530, 555, 575, 600)}. Using the same procedure as mentioned in the previous experiment, blood samples were taken at 30 min interval after 2AM. The results of their research published in their paper \textit{Action Spectrum for Melatonin Regulation in Humans: Evidence for a Novel Circadian Photoreceptor} the following conclusion:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Light irradiance greater or equal to $3.1 \mu W/cm^{2}$ evoke a significant melatonin supression}
\item \textbf{Smaller wavelenght monochromatic light have a greater change in \textit{Plasma Melatonin as Percent Change Control-Adjusted} for a fixed value of \textit{Photon density}} (\cite{ac2001} pp. 4-5).
\end{itemize}   

\subsection{Impact of light on human behaviour and sleep-wake cycle}
Among the Zeitgebers of the circadian rhythms, light being the major Zeitgebers has ipmortant effect on the human sleep-wake cycle. Christian \textit{et al.}\cite{cir2014} shown that subjective sleepiness and core body temperature opposes each other (\cite{cir2014}, pp. 12, fig. 2.1) when there is no phase lag or lead between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake cycle. The human normal sleep-wake cycle is comprised of 8h of sleep and 16h of wakefulness \cite{is1995}. This cycle is naturally affected by the human activities but is highly inflenced by light exposure. The study shows that office workers with bright blue office light have a better sleep-wake cycle than those with dim and warm office light. Furthermore, it shows that light exposure of sufficient intensity at night can reduce the secretion of melatonin with alerting response starting within the first 20mn. With the recent advance in LED technologies, human are no longer following the natural light/dark cycle causing numerous sleep disorders.

\section{LEDs technologies}

\subsection{LEDs and natural light}
The sun's electromagnetic rediation has a broad light spectrum ranging from  $100nm$ to $1mm$. After being filtered through the earth atmosphere, only certain portion of the spectrum is kept with the visible light spectrum having maximum irradiance. LED technologies are able to produce the same wavelenght as the sunlight but with much less irradiance. {\bf graph of light spectrum}  

\subsection{Sleep-wake cycle electronic devices}
With the discovery of the effect of light on the sleep-wake cycle, electronic devices producing specific light requirment have been used in treating patient with sleep discorder. \\
The same concept has been used to create a home bed lamp or alarm clock facilitating the regualtion of the slepp-wake cycle.
\subsubsection{C by GE Sol}
\textit{C} is a ``all-in-one smart light'' \cite{gesol} which has Amazon intelligent personal assistant Alexa built in. C has a various range of colour which are manually selected depending on the user preference. It is also capable of communicating wiht GE sol devices and smartphone allowing the device to be part of the user's network of devices. C is not clinically proven to be helpful in regulating or bebefiting the user's sleep-wake cycle.

\subsubsection{Philips Sunrise Alarm Clock}
Philips has created a broad range of sunrise alarm clocks. The recent versions are able to simulate sunrise and sunset which last from 20 to 40 mn, are able to be controlled by a smartphone application, and have many other functions. More importantly, they are the only wake-up lamp clinically proven to work \cite{philips}.

A literature review forms the theoretical basis of your project. You need to read a large number of
journal papers, sections in books, technical reports etc. relevant to your work at the start of project.
This will give you a good idea of the field of research.

When writing your review start of with the general concepts and move to the more specific aspects
explaining the necessary theory as you go. This section is NOT a copy and paste from others work or a
rewrite-but-change-one-word section. I suggest you read all your material, and then put it down and
write this section, referring back to the work only when you need to check something.

See your PCS textbook for more details on how to write a literature review.
