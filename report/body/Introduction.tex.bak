\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background to the study}
The human behavioural and anatomical activities are influenced by several internal cycles. One of these cycles, the \textbf{circadian rhythm} has been studies for more than \textbf{xx} years and its impacts on the human activity has lead to new interests in regulating these activities. Formally defined as a \textit{"cyclical changes in hormones, body temperature, and other biological processes obver the course of a 24 hour period"} [cite GE, definition], the \textbf{Natural Institute of Health} defines it as \textit{"a physical, mental and behavioural changes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle, reponding primarily to light and darkness in an organism's environment"}

 The impact of light is mostly observed in our daily activities which required identification of object throught vision. This has led to human being more activity during the day (presence of natural light) and not active (sleeping) during the night (absence of light). This behavioural relation between the human activities and light is due to the our anatomical structure. Researchs have shown that the human phisiological activities are regulated by internal clocks with one of them named the \textit{circadian rhythm} being affected by the presence of light.\\
    
With the recent advance in LED technologies, researches have shown that there is a corolation between the usage of LED technologies at night and sleep deficiency. Blueish light is said to have an huge impact on one of the human internal clock. Sleep deficiency due to inapropriate light exposure and patients with this problem have been cured using an optimal light exposure.\\
This study has shown that there is a way to improve the human sleep via light exposure. 
\section{Objectives of this study}
\subsection{Problems to be investigated}
Description of the main questions to be investigated in this study.
\subsection{Purpose of the study}
Give the significance of investigating these problems. It must be obvious why you are doing this study
and why it is relevant.

\section{Scope and Limitations}
The scope of this project involve the design of an functional embedded system named \textbf{NeoPixels Sunrise Clock} aslo known as \textbf{NPSC}, capable of producing light of \textbf{\( 460nm\) with an intensity of 30 lux} as mentioned by the paper \textit{\textbf{"Action Spectrum for Melatonin Regulation in Humans: Evidence for a Novel Circadian Photoreceptor"}}. The code and design artefact repository and a full documentation including a user manual, for anybody who wants to make use of the code design resources, also need to the delivered. Moreover, a descripion of future use of the device in the study of the effect of light on the circadian rhythm will be required.\\
This project does not study the effect of light on the users. For ethical reasons, the \textbf{NPSC} will not be tested  on human subjects in real situations of either waking humans or including lighting to facilitate sleep at night. Instead the system will be tested based on the recommendation from the research  literature.\\
The design and creation of the \textbf{NPSC} is subject to several constraints listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time:} The project has a duration of 12 weeks within which the research, design, development, implementation, verification, and report writing need to be done.
\item \textbf{Money:}  The project is allocated a budget of \textbf{R1000}
\
\item[Light:]
\item[Size:]
\item[Research:]
\end{itemize}
Scope indicates to the reader what has and has not been included in the study. Limitations tell the
reader what factors influenced the study such as sample size, time etc. It is not a section for excuses as
to why your project may or may not have worked.

\section{Plan of development}
Here you tell the reader how your report has been organised and what is included in each
chapter.

{\bf I recommend that you write this section last. You can then tailor it to your report.}
