\chapter{Future of the NPSC}

The NPSC was designed so that it could meet emit light with characteristics proven to affect the human circadian rhythm. In term of illuminance, it performed well above expectation, the range of illuminances and colours provided by the NPSC could be used to performed experiments on the effect of this device on the circadian cycle.\\
Sleep disorder is a major problem faced in developed countries, this is mainly due to blue light exposure at night. The NPSC could potentially intervene and provide a way to treat the patient by emitting certain wavelengths of light at certain illuminance. These parameters could be prescribed by medical professionals and loaded to the NPSC so that light treatment of sleep disorder can be done and home.
